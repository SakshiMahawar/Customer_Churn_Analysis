# Customer_Churn_Analysis

Description:

This project involves an in-depth analysis of customer churn for a telecom company, utilizing data from various sources to understand the key factors driving churn. The analysis focuses on multiple parameters, including internet type, payment method, contract type, tenure, and geographic distribution, to identify patterns and trends that influence customer behavior. The project aims to provide actionable insights to reduce customer churn rates and improve retention strategies.

Key Analysis and Visualizations:

1.Churn Rate by Internet Type:
   The churn rate is highest among customers using Fiber Optic (41.1%), followed by Cable (25.7%), DSL (19.4%), and those without internet service (7.8%).
   Fiber Optic customers show the highest churn rate, indicating potential issues with service quality, pricing, or customer satisfaction.

2.Churn by Payment Method:
  Customers paying by Mailed Check (37.8%) and Bank Withdrawal (34.4%) have higher churn rates compared to those using Credit Card (14.8%).
  This suggests a need to promote more stable payment methods, such as credit cards, which may correlate with lower churn rates.

3.Churn by Contract Type:
  Month-to-month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate (46.5%) compared to one-year (11%) and two-year (2.7%) contracts.
  Customers with longer contract commitments are less likely to churn, highlighting the importance of encouraging longer-term contracts.

4.Churn by Tenure:
  The churn rate decreases as customer tenure increases, with the highest churn rate observed in customers with a tenure of less than 3 years.
  This suggests that newer customers are more prone to churn, and targeted retention efforts should be focused on this segment.
  
5.Churn and Revenue by Geographic Distribution:
  The total churn is analyzed across different states, with higher churn observed in states like Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.
  Understanding geographic patterns can help tailor region-specific retention strategies.

6.Churn Breakdown by Additional Services:
  Churn rates are also analyzed based on the availability of additional services like Phone Service, Internet Service, Online Security, Online Backup, and Streaming TV.
  Customers not using additional services such as Online Security and Backup tend to have higher churn rates, indicating a potential area to upsell or cross-sell services.

 Conclusion:
  Based on the analysis, several key factors contributing to customer churn have been identified. High churn rates among customers using Fiber Optic, those on month-to-month contracts, and those paying by Mailed 
  Check or Bank Withdrawal indicate specific areas where improvements can be made. Furthermore, new customers with shorter tenures and those not subscribed to additional services are at a higher risk of leaving.
